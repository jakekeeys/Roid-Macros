# Roid Macros

### Customized for Weird Vibes:  
* Uses SuperWoW (if available) to avoid target swaps and buff debuff tracking.
* Empowers `/starattack` to avoid delaying OH swings when dual wielding
* `mybuff`, `mydebuff`, and `cooldown` all allow using `<`/`>` in the same way that `mypower` does
* Allows item id's to be used in macros instead of names, to shorten them
* New `zone`/`nozone` conditional, e.g.: `[zone:Naxxramas] [nozone:Orgrimmar]`
* `/use` can cast spells as well for mixing item use and spells together in macros, prefer `/cast` when you can for better performance.
* new `reactive`/`noreactive` conditional for detecting when things like Revenge are active. (Requires a bare Revenge on actionbars somewhere.)
* Allows limited nesting of macros:
```
/run -- CastSpellByName("Taunt")
/cast [stance:2] {"/run if not UnitIsUnit("targettarget","player") then CastSpellByName("Taunt","target") end"}
```
* Expanded the power of the `equipped` conditional:
```
/cast [equipped:Bows] Shoot Bow; [equipped:Crossbows] Shoot Crossbow; [equipped:Guns] Shoot Gun; [equipped:Thrown] Throw
/cast [equipped:Heartstriker/22811] Shoot Bow
/cast [equipped:Badge_Of_The_Swarmguard nocooldown:Death_Wish] Death Wish;Bloodthirst
```
* Expanded most conditionals to allow for multipe of the same type, for tigher control:
```
/cast [mypower>30 mypower<60 nocooldown:Bloodthirst] Bloodthirst
```
* Allows querying for stack infomation, `#` signifies you want a quantity instead of a duration:
```
/cast [stance:1/3 type:boss debuff:Sunder_Armor<#5]Sunder Armor;Bloodthirst
```
* Added casting conditional (SuperWoW only) to only act when a cast is occuring:
```
/cast [casting] Pummel
```
* Prefer using mybuff/mydebuff when you can, they are more likely to do what you want over [buff @player]
